## God is with us, overcome the enemy

God is our keeper and He really fights for us. He really is ready to face every battle you could ever want to face. As we talked about last Sunday, this image of God as a little old man sitting up there does not agree with what the Bible says. The pastor Myriam already read it in Isaiah chapter 27:1.

## Isaiah 27:1

>In that day the Lord with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, 
>even leviathan that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea.

This image is WOW! What an image! Can you imagine God having a peel with a Levitan. God is not scratching his belly in heaven. 

Jesus said the same thing this way:
> -My father is working, he is still working, he has not stopped working, he is still doing something and I am watching him - Jesus says.

And that is why Jesus did the tremendous works that he did, because he was watching what the father was doing. And so he also invites us: Look at your father, look at the Lord, see what he is doing and join him. 

God is not going to ask you to fight the battles that only He can fight, God is not going to ask you to stick your sword in that dragon in that serpent, He Himself is going to do it, He fights for you but He also invites us to take this position, to be emboldened and believe that God is for us, He is standing and we can stand.
